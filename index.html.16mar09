            for another 50,000 tickets priced at Rs 999/- (inclusive of taxes)

            fare will be available on select sectors on over 150 flights. 
            <BR>Just last week Air Deccan had released 1 lac tickets at a mind 
            boggling air fare of Rs 999/- (inclusive of taxes) which received 
            overwhelming response from the public, with the Air Deccan website 
            and Call Centre receiving countless hits and calls since the 
            bookings opened. <BR>The airline plans to continue this mega-sale of 
            tickets and is releasing a whopping 50,000 tickets at Rs 999/- 
            (inclusive of taxes). This is a golden opportunity for passengers 
            who missed out on the low fares last time. Air Deccan is truly 
            making people fly. With its low fares it is urging travelers to fly 
            on impulse and more frequently making air travel an affordable 
            option for the common man. <BR>Warwick Brady, Chief Operating 
            Officer Air Deccan spoke about the offer, “Air Deccan continues to 
            revolutionize air travel by making low cost air travel a reality for 
            the common man. We will continue to offer lowest fares and will not 
            be cowed down by the fares offered by full frill / high cost 
            airlines. Infact we have forced other airlines to drop their fares 
            and right from our inception we have aggressively been working 
            towards lowering our fares.”<BR>“This is a relatively lean season 
            for us and instead of carrying only 80% loads, we want to carry 100% 
            loads at low fares. To celebrate the success of our last Rs 999/- 
            offer for which we received terrific response from our passengers,
